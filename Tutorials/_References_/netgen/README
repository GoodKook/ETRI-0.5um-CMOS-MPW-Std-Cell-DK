This netgen tutorial is divided up into one directory per
tutorial.  All files needed for a tutorial are contained
in the individual tutorial directory (tut1, tut2, etc.).
In each directory, a file README.tutN (N = 1, 2, etc.) gives
brief instructions on what the tutorial is about and how to
run it and view the results.  A full description of all
tutorials can be found on the website
