Tutorial 6a

    This example has two files from a standard cell layout.
    One netlist has put the main circuit as the top level of
    the file, while the other netlist has put the circuit 
    in a subcell.  Running LVS normally results in the
    2nd circuit appearing to netgen to not have any contents.
    Note that the 2nd circuit defines a subcircuit but does
    not call it, so technically it is a library, not a
    circuit.

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut6a.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut6a.out

Tutorial 6b

    This shows how to call the LVS to ask it to compare against
    a specific cell found in a library file, which overcomes the
    problem in tutorial 6a.

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut6b.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut6b.out

Tutorial 6c

    The same LVS is run, but the file derived from the schematic
    does not include the subcircuits.  Netgen proceeds by
    defining the subcircuits as "black boxes".  This results in
    a valid comparison at the top level, but dumps a lot of
    warnings about the subcells themselves.

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut6c.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut6c.out

Tutorial 6d

    A setup file is used to read in the library of standard cells
    that was missing in tutorial 6c, and attach it to the
    netlist where it was missing.
    

    The setup file is setup_tut6d.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut6d.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut6d.out

Tutorial 6e

    A setup file is used to specifically declare each standard
    cell to be a "black box" circuit.

    The setup file is setup_tut6e.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut6e.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut6e.out
