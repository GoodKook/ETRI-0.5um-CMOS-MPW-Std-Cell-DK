Tutorial 8a

    This tutorial shows what happens when a netlist has
    "automorphs", or large symmetries in a cell that make
    certain pin groups of that cell permutable with other
    pin groups.  Netgen is unable to resolve the symmetries
    from the top level.

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut8a.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut8a.out

Tutorial 8b

    Using a setup file allows a subcell to be flattened, which
    removes the asymmetry of the cell, and makes the netlists
    equivalent. 

    The setup file is setup_tut8b.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut8b.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut8b.out
