    This tutorial shows what happens when a file fails to
    declare a global node.

	./runtut2a.sh

    Results are found in the file

Tutorial 2b

    Using a setup file allows a subcell to be flattened, which
    in this case makes the output of netgen easier to understand.

    The setup file is setup_tut2b.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut2b.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut2b.out

Tutorial 2c

    The setup file can also be used to modify the netlist.  In
    this case, the setup file declares the global nodes that
    were not properly declared in the netlist file.

    The setup file is setup_tut2c.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut2c.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut2c.out
