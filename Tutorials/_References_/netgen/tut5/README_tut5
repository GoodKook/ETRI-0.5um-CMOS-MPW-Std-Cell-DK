Tutorial 5a

    This is an example of a netlist comparison using standard
    cells.  The first example shows that when the standard cells
    in the two netlists have different names, netgen does not
    try to match them, but flattens everything in the netlist.

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut5a.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut5a.out

Tutorial 5b

    A setup file tells netgen how to match each standard cell
    in the first circuit with its equivalent cell in the
    second circuit.  This allows the LVS to proceed hierarchically.

    The setup file is setup_tut5b.tcl

    To run the tutorial:
	./runtut5b.sh

    Results are found in the file
	comp_tut5b.out
