When you run installLibs.sh from Vitis/2024.2/scripts, do you see any packages that can't be installed?

I know you've stated that your Ubuntu is 22.04.2 LTS

However, we have recently seeing an issue similar to what you've explained above. See this thread, where it seems like ${XILINX_VITIS}/lib/lnx64.o/Ubuntu/libstdc++.so.6 only supports up to GLIBCXX_3.4.25 and CXXABI_1.3.11, while libgallium and libLLVM require newer releases (up to GLIBCXX_3.4.30 and CXXABI_1.3.13).

However, the issue in the above mentioned thread, is with Ubuntu 24.04.1, where Ubuntu has 'forced' some updates to be applied, that are released only recently.

The following has helped other users (not sure if this will help here to, as in your case you are not running Ubuntu 24.04)

# Change to xilinx tool installation directory. By default, it is '/opt/Xilinx/'

    cd <xilinx_install_dir>

# Change to directory where problematic standard libraries are.

    cd Vitis/2024.2/lib/lnx64.o/Ubuntu/

# Make backup copies of your current libraries.

    mv libstdc++.so libstdc++.so.bkup
    mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bkup

# Soft-link system libraries.

    ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6
    ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so

# If the last step does not work due to wrong system libraries,
# you can look for them with this command:

    ldconfig -p | grep stdc++
