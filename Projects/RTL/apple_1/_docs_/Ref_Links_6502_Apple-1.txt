Reference: 6502 & Apple-1

[1] Ask google AI, "Is 6502 cpu still sold?"

Yes, modern versions of the 6502 CPU, primarily the CMOS W65C02S,
are still manufactured and sold by the Western Design Center (WDC)
for embedded systems, retro computing, and hobbyist projects,
despite the original MOS Technology version being discontinued,
with sales potentially in the millions annually due to low cost
and efficiency for simple tasks. You can find these new chips
through electronics distributors like Mouser. 

Key Points:
Modern Version: The WDC 65C02 is the current production version,
offering the same core functionality with improvements
like low-power CMOS technology.

Availability:
Available new from distributors like Mouser,not just as old stock (NOS).

Usage:
Popular for retro computer builds (like Ben Eater's 6502 computer),
embedded devices, and simple controllers where cost and simplicity matter.

Legacy:
The 6502's design influenced later processors, including the ARM
architecture, demonstrating its lasting impact.
