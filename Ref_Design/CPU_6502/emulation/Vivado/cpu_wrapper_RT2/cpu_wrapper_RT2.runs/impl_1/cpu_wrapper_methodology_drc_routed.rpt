TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks dut_clk_pin and emu_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks dut_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks emu_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks emu_clk_pin and dut_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks emu_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks dut_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT _1170_ has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
